# Laguna WordPress framework for custom plugin development

Custom plugin framework that contains many parts WordPress is missing for
proper coding of custom plugins. Logging, custom admin pages, several security
measures, view rendering, flash messaging and more.

### Installation and Usage

The plugin does very little on its own; however it provides a solid framework
for developers based on which they can code custom plugins.

Out of the box plugin does couple of enhancements to improve default site
security:

- allows administrators to change unsuccessful login errors
- removes WordPress generator version from HTML output

Developer functionality and helpers include:

- custom admin page generation
- logging with filters and separate administrative overview page
- view rendering as an alternative to mixing PHP logic and HTML
- various useful helper functions
